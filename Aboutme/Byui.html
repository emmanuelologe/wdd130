    <p> Hello, I am so glad for the opportunity to introduce myself. I am from Abuja, Nigeria. I am unmarried. I am the last of 4 children, I get to enjoy all the perks of being the last born</p>
    <p> I have always been drawn to technogy, starting with the obssesion to fix every spoilt appliance in the house. I recently completed Byu pathway Connect and it was an amazing experience. It helped to start a love for Programming that i didnt have in the past. I am so excited to learn and to grow along side you all. I am pursuing a degree in applied technology.</p>
    <p> I have been a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day saints all my life. Its been a year since i returned from my mission, it was a life changing experience. i am currently unemployed but searching, with the certificates offered through pathway worldwide i will be able to get jobs that will kick start my career.</p>
